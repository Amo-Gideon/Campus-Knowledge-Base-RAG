RESEARCH FOCUS: AI AND DATA SCIENCE LAB

Director: Professor Kwame Adjekum

The AI and Data Science Lab is a leading research center at AAMUSTED. Our current research projects are:

1. Project Anansi: Developing low-resource NLP models for local Ghanaian languages (Twi, Fante, Ga).
2. Project Sankofa: Using satellite imagery and machine learning for precision agriculture and crop disease detection.
3. Project Nkrumah: An initiative to build a large-scale multilingual dataset for West African historical texts.

The lab is equipped with a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster with 10 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. We collaborate with industry partners like Google AI and Meta AI.

Graduate students and final-year undergraduates can apply for research assistantships.
